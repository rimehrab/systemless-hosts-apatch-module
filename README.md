## FAQs & Fixes

  - [displax's safetynet-fix](https://github.com/Displax/safetynet-fix/releases)
  - [kdragon's safetynet-fix](https://github.com/kdrag0n/safetynet-fix/releases) probably with? [Dr-TSNG's ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/releases)
  - [chiteroman's PlayIntegrityFix](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix/releases) with [Dr-TSNG's ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/releases)
  - [Dr-TSNG's Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases)
- If Zygisk-Next is not working, install v4-0.8.1-126 or above.
- If you use APatch, you should use [Yervant7's ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Yervant7/ZygiskNext/releases).
- Always you can try [Yervant7's ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Yervant7/ZygiskNext) instead of [Dr-TSNG's ZygiskNext](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext) for both KernelSU and APatch
